⚠️ USBGuardGUI has no responsibility for USBGuard bugs or non-detection of devices managed by USBGuard. USBGuardGUI is just a GUI that interacts with USBGuard and DBus.

## Installation

Installation can be done via `.deb` file.

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Bigyls/USBGuardGUI/releases/latest) for download `.deb` file.

Run command (where `DEB_PACKAGE` is the downloaded file):
```shell
  sudo dpkg -i <DEB_PACKAGE>
```

⚠️ If you already have USBGuard installed everything will be ok **BUT** if it's not installed an error will appear during the `dpkg` command, just type the command `sudo apt -f install -y` after `dpkg` command, so that everything goes into the order. You can also [install USBGuard](/doc/USBGuard.md) step by step before `dpkg` command.

**Don't forget to logout/login after install.**
